# PM0 Documentation

This directory contains architecture, design, and technical documentation for the PM0 project.

## Structure

- `architecture_v2/` - Reference architecture diagrams and execution plans (v2)
- Additional documentation folders will be added as needed

## Contributing

When adding new architecture diagrams or documentation:
1. Use versioned folder names (e.g., `architecture_v2`, `architecture_v3`)
2. Include a README.md in each folder explaining the diagrams
3. Keep diagrams in PNG format for compatibility
4. Reference diagrams in technical briefs and PRDs
