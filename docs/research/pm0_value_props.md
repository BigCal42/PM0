# PM0 — Value Propositions (Investor-Grade, User-Centered)

## Executive Summary

This document crystallizes 3–5 resonant value propositions for PM0, grounded in end-user pains, overlooked gaps, and emerging trends. Each proposition is measurable, differentiated, and tied to a clear job-to-be-done.

---

## Value Proposition 1: Plan in Hours, Not Weeks

**Headline:** Cut Phase 0 planning from 3–6 weeks to 3–6 hours.

**The Problem:**
- Healthcare organizations spend $200K–$500K+ on Phase 0 discovery workshops with systems integrators.
- These workshops follow predictable templates: stakeholder interviews, gap analysis, staffing models, timeline estimates.
- The same 80% of questions repeat across projects.

**The Solution:**
- **Guided Intake:** Structured questionnaire → auto-complexity score → instant scenario templates (Baseline/Accelerated/Lean).
- **Instant Scenarios:** No waiting for SI consultants to re-model; scenarios generated in minutes.
- **Confidence Index:** Auto-computed from requirements coverage and gap analysis.

**Measurable Outcomes:**
- **Time Savings:** 3–6 weeks → 3–6 hours (80–95% reduction).
- **Cost Savings:** $200K–$500K per Phase 0 engagement → $0–$50K (self-service).
- **Analyst Hours:** Cut analyst hours by 80% via automation.

**Target Users:**
- Healthcare CIOs/CFOs who approve transformation budgets.
- PMO Directors who manage multiple planning projects.
- Enterprise Solution Architects who need to validate assumptions quickly.

**Differentiation:**
- Not another project management tool; PM0 is a **planning accelerator**.
- Not a consultant replacement; PM0 **automates the repeatable 80/20**.

**Proof Points:**
- "We spent $300K on Phase 0 planning, and 80% of it was boilerplate. There has to be a better way." — CFO, Health System

## Value Proposition 2: Cut 20–40% of Pre-Project Consulting Spend

**Headline:** Standardize the repeatable 80/20 and reduce SI dependency.

**The Problem:**
- Organizations repeat Phase 0 planning for every major initiative (Epic upgrades, Workday migrations, data lake consolidation).
- 60–80% of Phase 0 deliverables are boilerplate templates customized with client names and dates.
- SI consultants are in high demand; pricing is volatile.

**The Solution:**
- **Standardized Templates:** Reusable intake forms, complexity scoring, scenario generators.
- **Self-Service Planning:** Organizations can do Phase 0 planning themselves, reducing SI engagement.
- **Consultant Hours Avoided:** Track "savings-at-stake" metric: consultant hours avoided via automation.

**Measurable Outcomes:**
- **Cost Reduction:** 20–40% reduction in pre-project consulting spend.
- **SI Hours Avoided:** 120–240 analyst-hours per project automated via intake + scenario templates.
- **Repeatability:** Same planning framework across all projects (Epic, Workday, Data, etc.).

**Target Users:**
- CFOs who gatekeep transformation spend.
- PMO Directors who manage portfolios of projects.
- Healthcare organizations that run multiple transformation initiatives annually.

**Differentiation:**
- Not a consultant marketplace; PM0 **reduces consultant dependency**.
- Not a one-time tool; PM0 **standardizes repeatable planning** across projects.

**Proof Points:**
- "Every time we plan a new Epic upgrade, we start from scratch. Why isn't this standardized?" — PMO Director

## Value Proposition 3: Make Risk Visible, Not Inevitable

**Headline:** Gap heatmaps tied to stage-gates and cutover windows—before you commit.

**The Problem:**
- Gap analysis identifies missing roles, skills, or resources—but doesn't quantify impact on timelines.
- Stage-gates are dates on a Gantt chart—not linked to gap resolution.
- Organizations discover staffing gaps in Phase 2, not Phase 0—that's expensive.

**The Solution:**
- **Gap Heatmaps:** Phase × role matrix showing severity coloring and totals.
- **Stage-Gate Impact:** "This gap delays Stage-Gate 3 by 2–3 weeks" computed automatically.
- **Confidence Index:** "85% confidence in Stage-Gate 3 if we resolve these 3 gaps by M2."
- **Top Blockers:** Auto-identified top 3 largest gaps that block milestones.

**Measurable Outcomes:**
- **Early Detection:** Identify gaps in Phase 0, not Phase 2 (saves $100K–$300K per project).
- **Milestone Confidence:** Quantified confidence indexes (e.g., "85% confidence") instead of "we'll figure it out."
- **Timeline Accuracy:** Every 10% gap in required vs assigned capacity delays stage-gate ~2–3 weeks (quantified).

**Target Users:**
- Enterprise Solution Architects who need to validate assumptions.
- Program Managers who own stage-gate delivery.
- CIOs who need to de-risk go-live dates.

**Differentiation:**
- Not a gap tracking tool; PM0 **links gaps to timeline impact**.
- Not a risk register; PM0 **quantifies risk as timeline/cost deltas**.

**Proof Points:**
- "We discover staffing gaps in Phase 2, not Phase 0. That's expensive." — Program Manager
- "I need a single page to show gaps & cost impacts without calling a workshop." — Healthcare CIO

## Value Proposition 4: Explain It to Finance

**Headline:** One-page cost/effort deltas with 'why this plan' narrative—executives understand.

**The Problem:**
- Executives cannot greenlight multi-million-dollar transformations without quantified confidence.
- Key blocking questions remain unanswered: "Why this timeline?" "What if we accelerate/go lean?" "What's the risk-adjusted cost?"
- CFOs want scenario variance: "Show me baseline vs accelerated vs lean."

**The Solution:**
- **Scenario Comparison:** Baseline vs Accelerated vs Lean with timeline/FTE/cost deltas.
- **"Why This Plan?" Narrative:** AI-generated explanation tying inputs → outputs → risk trade-offs.
- **Executive Summary:** One-page cost/effort deltas with plain-English narrative.

**Measurable Outcomes:**
- **Faster Approvals:** Executives approve with quantified confidence (vs "it depends").
- **Scenario Variance:** Board-level demand met: "Show me baseline vs accelerated vs lean" (instant).
- **Risk Transparency:** Risk-adjusted costs presented as ranges, not single numbers.

**Target Users:**
- CFOs who gatekeep transformation spend.
- Board Members who approve multi-million-dollar programs.
- CIOs who need to explain plans to finance.

**Differentiation:**
- Not a financial model; PM0 **translates technical plans into executive narrative**.
- Not a dashboard; PM0 **answers "why this plan?" with quantified trade-offs**.

**Proof Points:**
- "I can't greenlight a $10M program without seeing scenario variance. Show me baseline vs accelerated vs lean, with quantified risks." — Board Member
- "I need to know: 'Why this plan?' Show me the inputs that led to these outputs, and the trade-offs." — Enterprise Architect

## Value Proposition 5: From Opinion to Options

**Headline:** Baseline vs Accelerated vs Lean trade-offs computed—not debated.

**The Problem:**
- Organizations compare scenarios by asking SI to re-model (additional cost/time).
- Scenarios are static documents: "Baseline: 18 months. Accelerated: 15 months."
- Boards ask: "What if we accelerate? What if we go lean?" → Requires re-engagement.

**The Solution:**
- **Live Scenario Modeling:** "What if I reduce scope by 20% and add 2 FTE?" → Instant delta.
- **Instant Comparison:** Baseline vs Accelerated vs Lean with timeline/FTE/cost deltas.
- **Risk Trade-offs:** "Accelerated timeline adds 30% cost risk" → Quantified, not anecdotal.
- **Scenario Lab:** Tweak levers (timeline %, scope %, FTE parallelization) with live deltas.

**Measurable Outcomes:**
- **Instant Answers:** Scenario comparison in minutes, not weeks (no SI re-engagement).
- **Quantified Trade-offs:** Timeline vs cost vs risk presented as computed deltas.
- **Reduced Debate:** "Opinion-based" planning → "data-driven" scenario comparison.

**Target Users:**
- Enterprise Solution Architects who need to validate assumptions.
- Board Members who ask "what if" questions.
- PMO Directors who compare scenarios across projects.

**Differentiation:**
- Not a scenario planning tool; PM0 **computes trade-offs instantly**.
- Not a financial model; PM0 **shows live deltas as you adjust levers**.

**Proof Points:**
- "I can't greenlight a $10M program without seeing scenario variance. Show me baseline vs accelerated vs lean, with quantified risks." — Board Member
