# Code of Conduct

## Purpose
We are committed to building PM0 as an inclusive, respectful, and high-integrity project. This code of conduct establishes the expectations for everyone who contributes issues, code, documentation, design assets, or participates in community spaces such as discussions and reviews.

## Our Standards
We expect all contributors to:
- Demonstrate empathy, patience, and respect in every interaction.
- Collaborate constructively by focusing on the problem instead of the person.
- Default to transparency and document decisions that affect the team.
- Follow project processes, including Conventional Commits and required reviews.
- Protect confidential information, including any non-public customer or patient data.

Behaviours that are not tolerated include:
- Harassment, discrimination, or disrespectful language.
- Sharing private or security-sensitive information without authorization.
- Knowingly introducing regressions or bypassing required checks.
- Dismissing feedback without justification or ignoring review comments.

## Scope
This code applies to all project spaces, including GitHub issues and pull requests, documentation, synchronous or asynchronous chats, and any real-world events or meetings representing PM0.

## Reporting & Enforcement
If you witness or experience behaviour that violates this code, please report it to the maintainers at [maintainers@pm0.dev](mailto:maintainers@pm0.dev). The maintainers will review every report, respond within five business days, and determine the appropriate action. Possible responses include clarification of expectations, request for apology, temporary or permanent removal from project spaces, or escalation to legal counsel.

Maintainers are accountable for fostering a welcoming environment and must model best practices. Repeated or severe violations may result in removal from the project and revocation of access to infrastructure, including Supabase or deployment environments.
