## 1. Executive Summary

**PM0 (Track A)** is an intelligent web application for **product management workflow automation**, purpose-built to help healthcare systems and large enterprises scope, plan, and align complex technology transformations. It is a **workflow-first platform** that blends **guided discovery, scenario modeling, and resource gap visualization** into a single product.

PM0’s unique value lies in solving the **“Phase Minus Zero”** challenge — the pre-implementation planning gap where organizations often burn resources before engaging system integrators or vendors. By providing **data-driven scoping, risk-aware planning, and scenario simulations**, PM0 empowers enterprises to begin transformations with clarity, alignment, and speed.
